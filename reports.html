       <br><b>American Institute for Free Labor Development
       <br>Date: 1971</b>
       <br>As the authors stated in the introductory remarks, "In this report we have tried to present an accurate picture of AIFLD's accomplishments over the comprised nine-year period. We feel that considering the difficulties involved, many of them outside our control, the accomplishments of the program were considerable. The conditions of the Peruvian world of his organization were better for our efforts. This is not true of the existence of many serious problems both external and internal to the democratic labor movement. It is to argue strongly that at the time it would be most unwise to leave the labor field wide open to extremist and other forces which have every intention of destroying the free and democratic labor movement, as we know it. Obvious patterns and programs are needed."
